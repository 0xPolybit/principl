# Princi

Princi is a programming language and compiler project. Its v0.1 Rust frontend
includes source loading, located diagnostics, a lexer, an AST, and a parser.
Semantic analysis and executable generation are still under development.

## v0.1 compiler contract

The only user-facing compiler workflow in v0.1 is:

```text
princi build <source-file>
```

Princi source files may use either `.prnc` or `.princi`. The extensions are
interchangeable: both identify the same source language and must have identical
parsing, semantics, and compilation behavior. For example, either of these
commands produces `hello.exe` beside its source file:

```text
princi build hello.prnc
princi build hello.princi
```

An output path can be selected with `-o`:

```text
princi build hello.prnc -o app.exe
```

The sole v0.1 target is Windows x86-64. There are no other user-facing compiler
commands in this version.

## Compiler architecture

The planned compilation pipeline is:

```text
source
  → lexer
  → parser
  → AST
  → semantic analysis
  → typed representation
  → LLVM IR
  → Windows object/native code
  → .exe
```

The compiler is implemented in Rust. The internal module boundaries are:

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `cli` | Parse `princi build`, source paths, and `-o`; select the v0.1 target. |
| `diagnostics` | Report source locations and actionable compilation errors. |
| `source` | Load source text and map byte spans to file, line, and column. |
| `lexer` | Convert source text into tokens. |
| `parser` | Parse tokens into the syntax tree. |
| `ast` | Define the source-oriented abstract syntax tree. |
| `semantic` | Check names, scopes, and language rules. |
| `types` | Represent and check source and typed-IR types. |
| `codegen` | Lower typed representation through LLVM IR to Windows output. |
| `runtime` | Provide only runtime support required by v0.1 programs. |

The CLI, source loader, diagnostics, lexer, AST, parser, compiler options, and
pipeline entry point are implemented. Semantic analysis, typed representation,
LLVM lowering, Windows executable generation, and runtime support remain under
development.

## v0.1 syntax

The parser accepts top-level `import` paths, `fn` declarations, `class`
declarations, and `struct` declarations. Functions and methods have typed
parameters, an optional `-> ReturnType`, and a block. Classes and structs may
contain typed fields, methods, and `init` constructors.

Function bodies support `let` and `var` declarations (inferred or explicitly
typed), assignments, nested blocks, `if`/`else`, `while`, `for name in
start..end`, `return`, and expression statements. Expressions include
identifiers, `self`, integer/floating-point/string/boolean literals, list
literals, `Type { field: value }` construction, calls, member access, indexing,
parentheses, unary `+`/`-`/`!`, ranges, and the binary operators listed in the
lexical syntax section.

Semicolons may separate statements; a line break also separates statements
when the next token cannot continue the preceding expression. Newlines after an
operator continue the expression. The range operator is non-associative unless
parenthesized. Binary operators associate left-to-right. From low to high, the
precedence is `..`, `||`, `&&`, `==`/`!=`, comparisons, `+`/`-`, `*`/`/`/`%`,
unary operators, then calls, member access, and indexing.

The parser retains end-exclusive UTF-8 byte spans throughout the AST and
reports source-positioned syntax diagnostics. It recovers at statement,
member, and declaration boundaries so a build can report multiple parse errors.
These syntax features define the v0.1 parser boundary; they do not imply that
semantic analysis or executable generation is complete.

## Supported lexical syntax

The lexer recognizes identifiers beginning with a Unicode letter or `_` and
continuing with letters, digits, or `_`; decimal integer and floating-point
literals (including exponents); double-quoted strings with `\\`, `\"`, `\n`,
`\r`, `\t`, and `\0` escapes; and `true`/`false` boolean literals. It recognizes
the keywords `fn`, `return`, `let`, `var`, `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `in`,
`class`, `struct`, `init`, `self`, and `import`.

Supported operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `=`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`,
`>`, `>=`, `&&`, `||`, `!`, `+=`, `-=`, and `*=`. Punctuation includes
parentheses, braces, brackets, comma, dot, colon, semicolon, `->`, and `..`.
Whitespace and `//` line comments are skipped. The lexer preserves semicolons
when present; whether they are required at a statement boundary is a parser
rule.

Each token carries its source file, 1-based line and character column, and
end-exclusive UTF-8 byte span. Located diagnostics use the format
`file:line:column: error: message`.

## Out of scope for v0.1

The following are explicitly excluded:

- Package manager, REPL, formatter, documentation generator, debugger, and IDE
  integration.
- Linux and macOS targets, WebAssembly, and targets other than Windows x86-64.
- Raw pointers, unsafe blocks, ownership and borrowing, and arenas.
- Async/await, traits, interfaces, inheritance, advanced generics, reflection,
  and Python interoperability.

See [the v0.1 scope and architecture](docs/v0.1-scope.md) for the canonical
boundary and details.

## Installation and development

Install the Rust stable toolchain with Cargo, then build or install the CLI from
the repository root:

```text
cargo build --release
cargo install --path .
```

Run the automated tests with:

```text
cargo test
```

The build command accepts either source extension:

```text
princi build hello.prnc
princi build hello.princi
princi build hello.prnc -o program.exe
```

The CLI validates and normalizes the input and output paths, then runs the
lexer and parser. Until semantic analysis and native code generation are
implemented, valid programs receive an explicit incomplete-stage diagnostic
and the command exits non-zero without claiming to have produced an executable.
